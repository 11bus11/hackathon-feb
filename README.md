## Initial MVP idea:
​
Our idea started out as a simple website for finding NGOs. When we were done discussing it, we had a home page, an event page, a donation page, and a socials page. We also had a search bar.
​
## Actual idea & content:
​
At the end we made the socials page and donate page into a single page. We also removed the search bar due to comming to the conclution that we would not have the time. We also developed the way the navigation looked.

That means that the website has these pages:
### Home page

### Donate page

### Event page

Other features:
### Navigation


### Footer
​
<< detail idea / features / functionality here >>
​
## Design
​
### Color Scheme:
<< detail your color palette here >>
We chose an orange and white colour palette. These colours are often used in similar pages, and work well with our layout ideas.
​
### Typography:
<< what font pairings did your team consider and pick? And why? >>
We chose Helvetica due to it being the one used on the WorldNGO website. To make the two websites feel connected, we too chose to use it. It is also san serif, which is easier to read on screans than serif fonts. 
​
### Imagery:
<< Detail imagery used to compliment your build & theme >>
We have a hero image, and logos for the different organisations. The logos are used in the list of featured organisations. It helps people to recognize the different NGOs.
​
<< ensure source attribution is maintained, and that you have used copyright-free material >>
​
### Wireframes:
​
* Mobile Wireframes:
​
<< put all your mobile wireframes here... >>
​
<< consider adding some notes to detail the planned components or functionality >>
​
* Desktop Wireframes:
​
<< put all your desktop wireframes here... >>

## Testing

### User stories testing
We wanted the user to:
* Find NGOs they can donate to.
    * These can be found on the donate page.
* Find events they can take part in.
    * These can be found on the events page.
* See what each featured organisation does.
    * The organisation summary explaines what each organisation does.
* Navigate the website easily.
    * There is a navbar at the top of the website. It is in the same position regardless of what page you are on.

We wanted the admin to:
* Be able to add, delete or change the featured organisations.
    * This can be done on the [admin page]()
* Be able to add, delete or change the events on the website.
    * This can be done on the [admin page]()

### Device testing
This website was tested natively on these devices:
- Desktop Computer (25" screen)
- Acer Aspire 5 (15" screen)

It was also tested on these devices with Mozilla- and Google dev tools:


### Browser testing
This website was tested on the following browsers:
* Mozilla Firefox
* Google Crome
* Microsoft Edge
* Safari
* DuckDuckGo (mobile)

### Validator testing

#### HTML 


#### CSS - Jigsaw


#### Python - pep8

### Lighthouse

### Manual Testing
* We tested if the data from the backend showed up correctly by asking the page to show it. 
* We did the testing of the images link in a similar way. When the name of the image-file had been added, we checked if it showed up in the frontend. If it did not, we inspected the page and checked what the link looked like in reality. That helped us find the problems.

### Bugs

#### Fixed bugs
* At first the logo images for the organisations did not show up. This was due to us having accidentally added an extra slash. To figure this out we inspected the page in the browser.

#### Unfixed bugs​
